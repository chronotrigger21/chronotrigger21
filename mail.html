                        <h4>I'm Ben Ratkey, and I want to mail you pieces of paper with my writing on them.</h4>
                        <p>I am writing a newsletter that does not exist digitally in any form. It's not published on Substack, you cannot read it on a blog, and I will not email it to you.</p>
                        <p>But if you share your mailing address with me, I will put a copy of my newsletter into an envelope, attach postage, handwrite your address on the envelope, and mail it to you.</p>
                        <h4>Who is this newsletter for?</h4>
                        <p>You should consider subscribing to this newsletter if:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You know who I am and you'd like to read medium and long-form writing from me.</li>
                            <li>You would enjoy receiving more paper mail that isn't junk, advertising, or bills.</li>
                            <li>You think this is an interesting idea, and you're curious to see how it turns out.</li>
                            <li>You have a shared interest in some of the same topics as me (see next section)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>What is the newsletter about?</h4>
                        <p>I'm writing about topics that catch my interest. That means the content of the newsletter will vary over time.</p>
                        <p>I'm fairly confident that you'll appreciate the newsletter if you share any of my interests. Here are a handful of topics that are likely to show up in my writing:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Philosophy of mind</li>
                            <li>Information theory</li>
                            <li>Humanity's relationship with technology (especially communication tech)</li>
                            <li>The structure and intricacies of human civilization</li>
                            <li>Memetics, genetics, natural selection, and gradient descent</li>
                            <li>Mythology, religion, and the occult</li>
                            <li>Humanity's relationship with egregores, ideologies, gods, and other psychofauna</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>What is the cost?</h4>
                        <p>There is no cost. The newsletter is free for subscribers. At this time, I have no plans to monetize this endeavor.</p>
                        <p>I might provide the option for subscribers to make small donations to help cover my printing and postage expenses, but I want that to be strictly voluntary.</p>
                        <h4>Are you going to spam me or exploit my privacy?</h4>
                        <p>Absolutely not.</p>
                        <p>I'm not going to go to the trouble of making paper copies and stuffing envelopes and spending money on postage unless I have something worthwhile to say. And besides, I don't have anything to sell you anyways. There's no gimmick or gotcha here.</p>
                        <p>The mailing address you share with me will remain 100% private. In fact, after you fill out the sign-up form, I will write your address down in a pen-and-paper notebook and delete the digital trail, so your information won't even be stored in a CRM or email marketing database. I will never sell your private information, because doing so would be a gross violation of my personal values.</p>
                        <h4 id="signup">How do I sign up?</h4>
                        <p>The only thing I need is for you to tell me what I should write on the envelope to ensure that it gets delivered to you.</p>
                        <p>Please make sure the mailing address you provide is fully complete and accurate.</p>
