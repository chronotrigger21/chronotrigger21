    <h2>Worldview Interview with deepfates: Apocalypse at the Anarchist Hippie Commune</h2>
    <p><em>December 15, 2021</em></p>
    <p>This is the second publication in my “Worldview Interviews” series. Each post is an edited transcript of a verbal
        interview, polished into a tidy, readable Q&A. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><em>You can read the
                first interview here.</em></span> My goal is to meet and chat with interesting people, while gaining a
        greater understanding of the experience of others and the way they see the world.</p>
    <p>The project originated with <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221129010529/https://twitter.com/BenRatkey/status/1450196332052889605">this
            tweet.</a></p>
    <p>This interview is with deepfates (<a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221129010529/https://twitter.com/deepfates">@deepfates</a> on Twitter).
        I asked my standard set of very broad questions, and then pulled the threads that seemed most intriguing to
        follow up. As always, no effort was made to argue, cross-examine, prove, or disprove. The contents of this
        interview are presented “as-is,” and I neither condemn nor endorse any of the perspectives contained within.</p>
    <p><strong>Ben:</strong> Let’s start with a very basic and very broad question: who and/or what are you? And how did
        you get here?</p>
    <p><strong>deepfates:</strong> I woke up here, because this is my house. And you are getting here by being piped
        through the Internet to me. I am deepfates in this conversation, representing the Twitter user “deepfates,” not
        necessarily my entire existence. Deepfates is a subsidiary character of myself.</p>
    <p><strong>Ben:</strong> You’re using words like “I am” and “me” and “myself” and “you.” What do those words mean?
        What kind of entities are they referring to?</p>
    <p><strong>deepfates:</strong> That’s a very good question; you’re digging into the real specific abstracts here.
    </p>
    <p>When I refer to “you,” I’m referring to the collection of matter and energy that is currently self-perpetuating
        in a region — wherever you live in your location. It’s your atoms, but not only those you can operate directly
        with your neurons; also your exo-cortex that surrounds you — your bookshelves and such.</p>
    <p>That’s who I’m referring to as “you” — as the general swirling pattern of matter that seems to follow you around.
    </p>
    <p>And when I say “me,” I’m referring either to me, Max, a person who is a swirling pattern in a similar way; or I’m
        referring to “me” as deepfates — a subsidiary mental character who is one of my swirling patterns around me. I
        use that character to distance my Twitter interactions from myself a little bit.</p>
