    <h2>Worldview Interview with deepfates: Apocalypse at the Anarchist Hippie Commune</h2>
    <p><em>December 15, 2021</em></p>
    <p>This is the second publication in my “Worldview Interviews” series. Each post is an edited transcript of a verbal
        interview, polished into a tidy, readable Q&A. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">You can read the
            first interview here.</span> My goal is to meet and chat with interesting people, while gaining a greater
        understanding of the experience of others and the way they see the world.</p>
