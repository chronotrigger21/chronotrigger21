    <h2>Worldview Interview with deepfates: Apocalypse at the Anarchist Hippie Commune</h2>
    <p><em>December 15, 2021</em></p>
    <p>This is the second publication in my “Worldview Interviews” series. Each post is an edited transcript of a verbal
        interview, polished into a tidy, readable Q&A. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><em>You can read the
                first interview here.</em></span> My goal is to meet and chat with interesting people, while gaining a
        greater understanding of the experience of others and the way they see the world.</p>
    <p>The project originated with <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221129010529/https://twitter.com/BenRatkey/status/1450196332052889605">this
            tweet.</a></p>
    <p>This interview is with deepfates (<a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221129010529/https://twitter.com/deepfates">@deepfates</a> on Twitter).
        I asked my standard set of very broad questions, and then pulled the threads that seemed most intriguing to
        follow up. As always, no effort was made to argue, cross-examine, prove, or disprove. The contents of this
        interview are presented “as-is,” and I neither condemn nor endorse any of the perspectives contained within.</p>

    <!-- FIXME: turn this into a class in styles.css -->
    <p><strong>Ben:</strong> Let’s start with a very basic and very broad question: who and/or what are you? And how did
        you get here?</p>
    <p><strong>deepfates:</strong> I woke up here, because this is my house. And you are getting here by being piped
        through the Internet to me. I am deepfates in this conversation, representing the Twitter user “deepfates,” not
        necessarily my entire existence. Deepfates is a subsidiary character of myself.</p>
    <p><strong>Ben:</strong> You’re using words like “I am” and “me” and “myself” and “you.” What do those words mean?
        What kind of entities are they referring to?</p>
    <p><strong>deepfates:</strong> That’s a very good question; you’re digging into the real specific abstracts here.
    </p>
    <p>When I refer to “you,” I’m referring to the collection of matter and energy that is currently self-perpetuating
        in a region — wherever you live in your location. It’s your atoms, but not only those you can operate directly
        with your neurons; also your exo-cortex that surrounds you — your bookshelves and such.</p>
    <p>That’s who I’m referring to as “you” — as the general swirling pattern of matter that seems to follow you around.
    </p>
    <p>And when I say “me,” I’m referring either to me, Max, a person who is a swirling pattern in a similar way; or I’m
        referring to “me” as deepfates — a subsidiary mental character who is one of my swirling patterns around me. I
        use that character to distance my Twitter interactions from myself a little bit.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">&bull; &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; &bull;</p>
    <!-- FIXME: turn this into a class in styles.css -->
    <p><strong>Ben:</strong> Okay, so we’ve got things like “you” and “I.” Then, maybe there’s also other things that
        are neither you nor I? What is the world around us? What is this universe that we find ourselves in?</p>
    <p><strong>deepfates:</strong> That’s an important distinction. I would say that the world is one thing and the
        universe is another thing.</p>
    <p><strong>Ben:</strong> Okay. Tell me more about that.</p>
    <p><strong>deepfates:</strong> The universe is a sort of mathematical unfolding that is happening, and possibly has
        up to four levels of multiverses (according to the last physics book I read, a few years ago).</p>
    <p>There are many different possible universes that could exist. And “the world” does not necessarily exist in all
        of them.</p>
    <p>The world is the thing that we are on, the thing that we are <strong><em>of</em></strong> — the world is the
        <em><strong>life thing.</em></strong> And it can only exist in some universes.
    </p>
    <p>(I don’t have strong definitions for all of this, although I have weirdly specific concepts of it. I’m just
        trying to taboo myself a little bit from saying words that are too easy to reach for.)</p>
    <p>The world is not the planet; the planet is part of the universe. It’s just a rock spinning through space. The
        world is the little green skin that lives on the outside of it.</p>
    <p><strong>Ben:</strong> Do you have some sense of how this world got here? How did it come to be?</p>
    <p><strong>deepfates:</strong> I don’t have a strong, logical understanding of this through any systematic way. But
        the sense I do have is that the whole thing is sort of a fractal pattern with emergent attractors. Do you know
        what I mean by that?</p>
    <p><strong>Ben:</strong> Let’s expand a little bit. I think I do, but I want to hear it in your words. You don’t
        have to go deep into physics or anything.</p>
    <p><strong>deepfates:</strong> I don’t know much physics, so I couldn’t anyways.</p>
    <p>Let’s say that you’re in the bathtub, and when you drain the bath, you get a whirlpool: a little emergent vortex.
        That little swirling thing isn’t like a noun; you can’t grab it. If you have a hole in some Swiss cheese,
        there’s nothing there that you can actually touch. The hole only exists in the context of this other scenario
        where it has emerged.</p>
    <p>And so this emergent property, the whirlpool — it doesn’t always show up. Not all bathtubs have one every single
        time they drain. Not all universes have life; but in some of them, there are enough mechanical factors at play
        that they can start clicking into something and doing evolution. Then you start getting a world, and then that
        evolutionary process also happens on a fractal level.</p>
    <p>So each of us is kind of like a little whirlpool, in a similar way — an emergent part of the larger spin. A
        little whirlpool next to the bigger whirlpool.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">&bull; &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; &bull;</p>
    <!-- FIXME: turn this into a class in styles.css -->
    <p><strong>Ben:</strong> So, in this world that we find ourselves in, is there such a thing as “true” and “false?”
        And if so, how do you differentiate them?</p>
    <p><strong>deepfates:</strong> Sure, there’s things that are true and false, and you can differentiate them.</p>
    <p>There’s a difference between going hungry and getting food, as one example. We exist within this evolutionary
        system that functions by constantly checking itself against True and False. So, if you’re out there looking for
        food in the desert, you might just keep walking and find nothing but cactuses. If you’re unable to eat cactuses,
        then you’re gonna die.</p>
    <p>But first, you’re going to be hungry. You get a little gradient descent before you get the final loss factor,
        which is: did you Die or did you Not Die? You can’t fake your way out of it.</p>
    <p>I don’t know whether there are people out there who really believe that there’s no such thing as True and False;
        but if there are, I bet they don’t go hungry very often.</p>
    <p><strong>Ben:</strong> I’ve heard of such a thing as people who aspire to live on just breathing and not taking in
        food at all.</p>
    <p><strong>deepfates:</strong> I’ve met some of those people.</p>
    <p><strong>Ben:</strong> Have you? Interesting. It seems like you’ve met a lot of interesting people.</p>
    <p><strong>deepfates:</strong> I have. That’s one of the ways I got to where I am now.</p>
    <p>I have met people who claim to be learning breatharianism; I have never met a successful breatharian. But I have
        met fruitarians who are working on their breatharianism, and who have gurus who are teaching them.</p>
