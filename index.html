		<h2>An online home in a digital neighborhood</h2>
		<h3>I'm Ben Ratkey. This is my personal website.</h3>
		<p>It's extremely simple for now, but I'm working on adding more bit by bit.</p>
		<p>I plan to build in public and gradually add to this website, treating it as my home on the internet.</p>
		<p>You're visiting my home right now! Thanks for dropping by.</p>
		<p>Anything and everything on this site is subject to change at a moment's notice, as whimsy dictates.</p>
