                        <h1>philadelphia and vibecamp</h1>
                        <p><em>Monday, June 12, 2023</em></p>
                        <p>I grew up in Wisconsin, and I live in Houston. I've spent hardly any time at all in any east coast cities.</p>
                        <p>This week, I'm staying in Philadelphia for a few days before going to <a href="https://vibe.camp/">Vibecamp</a>,
                            so I'm forming first impressions of the city.</p>
                        <h3>Philadelphia is <em>grungy</em> as fuck.</h3>
                        <p>H/T to <a href="https://twitter.com/samuelmachat">Samuel</a> for supplying this adjective, which really is the
                            perfect descriptor.</p>
                        <p>The city is full of trash, it smells like sewage and body odor, the buildings appear to be cobbled together from
                            whatever materials were on hand after a wrecking ball destroyed the building next door, and every corner of
                            every space is densely packed with mismatched furniture, inexplicable man-made junk, and exposed pipes and
                            wires.</p>
                        <p>And all of this somehow synergizes to spawn an irrefutably <em><strong>charming</strong></em> aesthetic that
                            could
                            only emerge organically
                            from
                            generations of habitation by East Coast American human beings.</p>
                        <p>It feels alive and lived-in. It feels like the inevitable emergent habitat of the particular type of sapient
                            animals that live in this region. Philadelphians stack red brick and sheet metal into habitable structures the
                            way a beaver piles up branches and twigs into a dam.</p>
                        <h3>I've been in this city for 18 hours.</h3>
                        <p>In that time, I've sat on the subway across from a skeletal, trembling woman with scars and track marks
                            crisscrossing both arms.</p>
                        <p>I've seen two dads going for a walk with their baby strapped to a front-facing carrier
                            on their chest.</p>
                        <p>I've been warned to avoid a certain neighborhood with open-air drug markets.</p>
                        <p>I've been told by an Uber driver that a major highway recently caught fire and literally
                            collapsed.</p>
                        <p>I've watched an apparent real-time montage of gentrification unfold around me as I walked just a mile from one
                            neighborhood to another.</p>
                        <p>And I've still got a week ahead of me.</p>
