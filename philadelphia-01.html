    <h2>Philadelphia and Vibecamp</h2>
    <p><em>Monday, June 12, 2023</em></p>
    <p>I grew up in Wisconsin, and I live in Houston. I've spent hardly any time at all in any east coast cities.</p>
    <p>This week, I'm staying in Philadelphia for a few days before going to <a href="https://vibe.camp/">Vibecamp</a>,
        so I'm forming first impressions of the city.</p>
    <h3>Philadelphia is <em>grungy</em> as fuck.</h3>
    <p>H/T to <a href="https://twitter.com/samuelmachat">Samuel</a> for supplying this adjective, which really is the
        perfect descriptor.</p>
    <p>The city is full of trash, it smells like sewage and body odor, the buildings appear to be cobbled together from
        whatever materials were on hand after a wrecking ball destroyed the building next door, and every corner of
        every space is densely packed with mismatched furniture, inexplicable man-made junk, and exposed pipes and
        wires.</p>
    <p>And all of this somehow synergizes to spawn an irrefutably <em><strong>charming</strong></em> aesthetic that
        could
        only emerge organically
        from
        generations of habitation by East Coast American human beings.</p>
    <p>It feels alive and lived-in. It feels like the inevitable emergent habitat of the particular type of sapient
        animals that live in this region. Philadelphians stack red brick and sheet metal into habitable structures the
        way a beaver piles up branches and twigs into a dam.</p>
    <h3>I've been in this city for 18 hours.</h3>
    <p>In that time, I've sat on the subway across from a skeletal, trembling woman with scars and track marks
        crisscrossing both arms.</p>
    <p>I've seen two dads going for a walk with their baby strapped to a front-facing carrier
        on their chest.</p>
    <p>I've been warned to avoid a certain neighborhood with open-air drug markets.</p>
    <p>I've been told by an Uber driver that a major highway recently caught fire and literally
        collapsed.</p>
    <p>I've watched an apparent real-time montage of gentrification unfold around me as I walked just a mile from one
        neighborhood to another.</p>
    <p>And I've still got a week ahead of me.</p>
