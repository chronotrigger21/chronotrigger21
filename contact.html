		<h2>How to contact Ben Ratkey</h2>
		<h3>Email</h3>
		<p>I love email. This is the most consistent and reliable way to reach me. My email address is:</p>
		<p><strong>benratkey <em>[AT]</em> gmail <em>[DOT]</em> com</strong></p>
		<p>If you send a message there, I will definitely see it (as long as it doesn't get caught by a spam filter). I usually reply to personal emails within a day or two.</p>
		<h3>Twitter</h3>
		<p>Twitter is usually a good way to reach me. My Twitter handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/BenRatkaj">@BenRatkaj</a>.</p>
		<p>Sometimes, I take breaks from Twitter and completely log out from my account for a week or more. You can look at my recent tweets to check whether I'm currently on a break.</p>
		<h3>Text Messages and Phone Calls</h3>
		<p>This is the contact method with the lowest latency; I respond pretty quickly to text messages.</p>
		<p>You can have my phone number if we're friends. Just ask!</p>
		<h3>Discord</h3>
		<p>I don't spend much time hanging out on Discord, but if you DM me there I will probably see your message.</p>
		<p>You can become friends with me on Discord by connecting with me through another channel first.</p>
		<h3>Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok</h3>
		<p>These are not good ways to contact me.</p>
