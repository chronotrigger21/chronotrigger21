    <h2>How to contact Ben Ratkey</h2>
    <h3>Email</h3>
    <p>I love email. This is the most consistent and reliable way to reach me. My email address is:</p>
    <p><strong>benratkey <em>[AT]</em> gmail <em>[DOT]</em> com</strong></p>
    <p>If you send a message there, I will definitely see it (as long as it doesn't get caught by a spam filter). I
        usually reply to personal emails within a day or two.</p>
    <h3>Twitter</h3>
    <p>My Twitter handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/BenRatkaj">@BenRatkaj</a>.</p>
    <p>In the past, I used Twitter a lot. Nowadays, it's a less reliable way to reach me. But if you contact me on
        Twitter, I'll probably see it eventually.</p>
    <h3>Text Messages and Phone Calls</h3>
    <p>This is the contact method with the lowest latency; I respond pretty quickly to text messages.</p>
    <p>You can have my phone number if we're friends. Just ask!</p>
    <h3>Discord</h3>
    <p>I don't spend much time hanging out on Discord, but if you DM me there I will probably see your message.</p>
    <p>You can become friends with me on Discord by connecting with me through another channel first.</p>
    <h3>Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok</h3>
    <p>These are not good ways to contact me.</p>
